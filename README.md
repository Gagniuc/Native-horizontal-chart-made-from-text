# utf-horizontal-bar-chart

Ex. (85) - Horizontal chart with UTF characters proportional with max array.


This code performs several operations on an array a and generates a UTF-8 text-based bar chart, where the length of each bar is proportional to the corresponding element in the array <i>a</i> concerning the maximum value in the array. An array <i>a</i> is defined with a set of numeric values. Variables <i>m</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>max_value</i> are initialized. Variable <i>m</i> represents the total number of characters for each bar in the chart, <i>t</i> will store the final text result, and <i>max_value</i> will keep track of the maximum value in the array. The length of the array <i>a</i> is determined and stored in variable <i>n</i>. A for-loop is used to find the maximum value in the array. It iterates through each element of <i>a</i>, and if the current element is greater than the current <i>max_value</i>, it updates <i>max_value</i> with the current element. Another for-loop is used to create the bar chart. It iterates through each element of <i>a</i> again. Inside the second loop, a variable <i>f</i> is calculated. It represents the length of the current bar and is calculated as (<i>m</i> / <i>max_value</i>) * <i>a</i>[<i>i</i>], which scales the length of the bar based on the ratio of the current element value to the maximum value in the array. Within a nested loop (for-loop with variable <i>k</i>), the code checks if <i>k</i> is less than <i>f</i>. If <i>k</i> is less than <i>f</i>, it appends a filled square character (“▮”) to the string <i>t</i>, indicating the filled portion of the bar. Otherwise, it appends an empty square character (“▯”) to represent the empty portion of the bar. After each bar is constructed, the code adds a newline character to <i>t</i> to start a new line for the next bar. Next, the resulting <i>t</i> variable, containing the text-based bar chart, is printed to the console. This code essentially visualizes the values in the array <i>a</i> by representing them as bars in a simple text format, where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents concerning the maximum value in the array.
